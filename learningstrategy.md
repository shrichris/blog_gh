This is a strategy that works for me.

It replaces a typical loop of lecture -> readings/labs for that lecture -> assignments for that lecture (iterate), with an multi pass approach. This involves bingeing through all lectures in 1 pass. 

Multi Pass:
* First pass - Go through all lectures. Ensure basic level of comfort with the key ideas. Take key notes. Compile links to resources
* Second pass - Workthough labs. 
* Third pass (if required) - Complete assignments. Take exams


Why?
